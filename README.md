This system is for measuring low voltage (max 1.25V) from peltier modules with load 25 ohms. Data is written on SD as often as you want (recomended min 10s).

SET CALIBRATION FIRST AND DO NOT SWAP RESISTORS. Basically you can measure any low-voltage generator with good accuracy (step around 1.0009mV when Vref=1.1V). You can change values of R1 and R2 to get different range of max voltage. Output file open in text editor and you can load data to MS Excel for better data processing.

Feel free use it and change in your program.

Everything what can you measure, can be upgraded.
